Nele	De Schepper	notComing		talkAnalysis	Yes	Not coming		New results on the radially deformed Dirac operator	Hendrik De Bie and David Eelbode	Let {ei},i=1,…,m, be an orthonormal basis of Rm. The orthogonal Clifford algebra Clm is generated by this basis under the relations eiej+ejei=−2δij. It is well-known that the classical Dirac operator ∂x−=∑mi=1ei∂xi and its Fourier symbol x−=∑mi=1eixi generate via Clifford multiplication a natural Lie superalgebra osp(1|2) contained in the Clifford-Weyl algebra. More surprisingly, this carries over to a natural family of deformations of the Dirac operator. Indeed, the radially deformed Dirac operator D:=∂x−+c|x−|−2x−E,c>−1 and the vector variable x− also form a realization of osp(1|2) in the Clifford-Weyl algebra. Here E=∑mi=1xi∂xi is the Euler operator measuring the degree of homogeneity. In [H. De Bie, B. Orsted, P. Somberg and V. Soucek, Dunkl operators and a family of realizations of osp(1|2). Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 364 (2012), 3875--3902] several function theoretical aspects of the operator D are studied, such as the associated measure, the Fischer decomposition, the related Laguerre polynomials and the associated Fourier transform defined by FD=eiπ2(12+m−12(1+c))e−iπ4(1+c)2(D2−(1+c)2x−2). The investigation of this radially deformed Fourier transform is continued in [H. De Bie, B. Orsted, P. Somberg and V. Soucek, The Clifford deformation of the Hermite semigroup. SIGMA 9 (2013), 010, 22 pages], using a group theoretical approach. The aim of this talk is to further develop the study of the radially deformed Dirac operator, focussing on the conformal structure of D and the derivation of an explicit form for the kernel of the deformed Fourier transform FD. More precisely, we construct a set of differential operators that leave the kernel of D invariant. These set of generalised symmetries of D generate a Lie algebra which is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra so(m+1,1). Next, a version of Stokes' theorem for the radially deformed Dirac operator is obtained. Moreover, explicit formulas for the kernel of the radially deformed Fourier transform FD are obtained when the dimension is even and 1+c=1n, n∈N0∖{1} with n odd. Finally, the realization of osp(1|2) is generalized by adding suitable odd powers of Γ=−x−∂x−−E to the radially deformed Dirac operator.

Pierre-Philippe	Dechant	talkGeometry	representation theory, different applications	talk	Yes	Coming		Platonic solids generate their four-dimensional analogues		We show how regular convex 4-polytopes – the analogues of the Platonic solids in four dimensions – can be constructed from three-dimensional considerations concerning the Platonic solids alone. Via the Cartan–Dieudonne theorem, the reflective symmetries of the Platonic solids generate rotations. In a Clifford algebra framework, the space of spinors generating such three-dimensional rotations has a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure. The spinors arising from the Platonic solids can thus in turn be interpreted as vertices in four-dimensional space, giving a simple construction of the four-dimensional polytopes 16-cell, 24-cell, the F4 root system and the 600-cell. In particular, these polytopes have ‘mysterious’ symmetries, that are almost trivial when seen from the three-dimensional spinorial point of view. In fact, all these induced polytopes are also known to be root systems and thus generate rank-4 Coxeter groups, which can be shown to be a general property of the spinor construction. These considerations thus also apply to other root systems such as A1⊕I2(n) which induces I2(n)⊕I2(n), explaining the existence of the grand antiprism and the snub 24-cell, as well as their automorphism symmetries. These results are discussed in the wider mathematical context of Arnold’s trinities and the McKay correspondence. These results are thus a novel link between the geometries of three and four dimensions, with interesting potential applications on both sides of the correspondence, to real three-dimensional systems with polyhedral symmetries such as (quasi)crystals, viruses and carbon onions, as well as four-dimensional geometries arising for instance in Grand Unified Theories and String and M-theory.
Jaroslav	Hrdina	talkGeometry	differential geometry	talk				Geometry of almost Cliffordian manifolds		We deals with Clifford algebras and geometric structures over them. Motivated by the fact that the choice of the projective structure corresponds to the choice of the class of connections sharing geodesics and the choice of "complex" projective structure corresponds to the choice of connections sharing the $J$-planar curves, we define the projective $A$-structures as $A$-structures together with the choice of connection class sharing $A$-planar curves. If $A$ is a Clifford algebra, we obtain a class of so called Cliffordian projective structures.

We use rational Bezier formulas with Clifford algebra weights for parametrization of principal Dupin cyclide patches. Several well known and several new geometric properties of Dupin cyclides are derived using this approach. As an example of application we present construction of surfaces for visualizing voids and channels in large biomolecules (treated as the union of Van der Waals balls). 
Yue	Liu	talkAlgebra	algebra, computational geometry	talk		Coming	not Aug 9 (leaves Tartu Aug 9, 8:30 in the morning)	Basis-Free Quaternionic or Clifford Polynomial Manipulations: Mathematical Completeness 	Hongbo Li, Lei Huang, Shoubin Yao, Ge Li	In geometric computing, directions, lines, spheres, etc. may be represented by single vector variables, and symbolic manipulations of these variables may not resort to their explicit coordinate forms. This raises the following question: if a geometric conclusion can be derived from the coordinate forms of the variables, is it always true that the conclusion is derivable from some coordinate-free manipulations of the variables in coordinate-free form? If so, how to derive them in the latter approach? This is the mathematical completeness problem that must be answered by any coordinate-free symbolic algebraic system to be used in geometric computing. This talk introduces our recent work started in 2013 on the the mathematical completeness of basis-free (hence coordinate-free) symbolic manipulations of quaternionic polynomials in quaternionic variables, and of Clifford polynomials in vector variables taking values in a general 3D non-degenerate inner-product space. By now some striking results have been obtained. The conclusions are rather simple to describe, but the proofs are highly complicated.

Yizengaw	In this talk, given an algebra sheaf A on a topological space X, we introduce sheaves of Clifford A-algebras (\textit{Clifford A-algebras,} for short) on X associated with arbitrary quadratic A-modules as quotient sheaves of tensor algebra sheaves over certain ideal sheaves. We also study two main A-isomorphisms of Clifford A-algebras: \textit{the main involution} and \textit{the anti-involution A-isomorphisms.} Finally, we give a definition for \textit{the natural filtration of Clifford A-algebras} and show that for every A-algebra sheaf E, endowed with a regular filtration, one obtains a new graded A-algebra sheaf, denoted Gr(E), which turns out to be A-isomorphic to E.

Bernd Anton	Schmeikal	notComing	algebra, geometric algebra	talk		Not coming		Iteration of Clifford Algebra		Abstract: An eightfold path leads to the historic objects of quaternions, that is, fourdimensional real algebras of hypercomplex numbers that involve a triple of magnitudes {i, j, k} with eight possible signatures. Picking up an observation of Gerhard Opfer, Sprössig and me specified an idea which aimed at the derivation of the eight historic algebras, quaternions, coquaternions, tessarines, cotessarines and the four remaining ones from a fundamental mother algebra. This idea turned out to lead on, and we could show that these basic modules of analysis, being subalgebras of the Clifford algebra of Minkowski space could be traced back to the mother algebra of cotessarines, by an algebraic method of iteration originally introduced into discrete physics by Louis Kauffman. Extending this procedure over all associative Clifford algebras it can be shown that these can be represented as ‘iterant algebras’. Algebraically this refers to semidirect products of permutation symmetries with basic sets of binary sequences. Phenomenologicly we are actually iterating the structure of a Clifford algebra. As the iteration represents a temporal or ‘diachronic’ process whereas the geometric structure is a synchronous object, we are indeed dealing with the linguistic duality of diachronic versus synchronous. In this way an apparently synchronous geometric structure of space and time can be understood as a temporally built up entity of a process. In this talk it is shown how this goes.
Dmitry	Shirokov	talkAlgebra	algebra, Yang-Mills?	talk		Coming		The method of contractions in Clifford algebras		We consider real and complex Clifford algebras Cℓ(p,q) with fixed basis {eA} where A is multi-index A∈I={−,1,…,n,12,13,…,1…n}. For any element U∈Cℓ(p,q) we study expressions (contractions) ∑A∈SeAUeA for different S⊆I. We present the relation between contractions and projection operators onto fixed subspaces of Clifford algebra. We present solutions of commutator system of equations eAX+ϵXeA=qA,∀A∈S,ϵ∈C for unknown X∈Cℓ(p,q). Also we consider generalized contractions ∑A∈SγAUβA,S⊆I for two different bases {γA}, {βA}. With the aid of these contractions we present formulas for element T such that γa=JT−1βaT,a=1,…,n,J=±e,±e1…n,±ie1…n. The method of contractions allow us to give solution of ''the simplest'' field equation in the pseudo-euclidian space and to present the new class of gauge-invariant solutions of the Yang-Mills equtions.

Suzuki	In this talk we introduce the idea of Galois extension for an associative algebra and show how binary and ternary algebras can be described by such an algebraic construction. Special attention is devoted to Grassmann and Clifford algebras where the binary and ternary structures emerge from Galois Extensions. Galois groups are also considered but, unlike field extensions, these will be continuous groups. Gauge invariance is also discussed in terms of Galois group of extensions. The particular ternary structure of Nonion algebra is described by means of Galois extensions, revealing the continuous Z3 structure of Galois group. Ternary versions of Klein-Gordon and Dirac operators are discussed and quark models are constructed by use of Galois extensions.

Hoff da Silva and Roldão da Rocha	VSR symmetries are here naturally incorporated in the DKP algebra on the spin-0 and the spin-1 DKP sectors. We show that the Elko (dark) spinor fields structure play an essential role on accomplishing this aim, unravelling hidden symmetries on the bosonic DKP fields, which manifest the intrinsic VSR symmetries of Elko fields.

Associators for the product of three and four multipliers are defined. It is shown that using a special choice of parameters the associator of the product of four supersymmetry generators is connected with the angular momentum operator. The connection of operators decomposition with the hidden variables theory and alternative quantum mechanics is discussed.
Valeriy	Dvoeglazov	talkPhysics	electromagnetism, general relativity	talk	Yes	Coming	not Aug 9 (leaving flight Aug 9 6:05)	Energy-Momentum Tensor in Electromagnetic Theory and Gravitation from Relativistic Quantum Equations		We analyze the problems of definitions of the energy-momentum tensors in the electromagnetic theory and the general relativity. The Bargmann-Wigner formalism has been used for higher spins. It is based on the Dirac equations for high-rank 4-spinors. We compare our results with those obtained by the group of Acad. Logunov and Prof. Khrapko. The conclusion is that it is possible to define the energy-momentum tensor compatible with the Noether theorem in any relativistic theory, in self-consistent ways. Different opinions presented in articles and books have been discussed. Possible methods of experimental verification have been proposed. 
Anthony	Lasenby	talkPhysics	gravity	talk	Yes	Coming		f(R) theories and Gauge Theory Gravity		We consider a `Gauge Theory of Gravity' approach to f(R) theories. These theories, where the gravitational part of the Lagrangian is generalised to a general function, f(R) of the Ricci scalar, have over recent years become very popular as possible theories of modified gravity, and have been applied to explanations of both Dark Energy and Dark Matter. Two different variants exist, one based on a purely metric approach, and the other, `Palatini f(R) theory', where the equations are derived via treating the connection as an independent entity, and there has been considerable discussion over which of these approaches should be adopted, and which, if either, is compatible with the observations. In Gauge Theory Gravity, which is based on the Geometric Algebra of spacetime, relativistic gravity is treated as much as possible as a gauge theory like others, and the independent variables are derived from local symmetry principles. This means the route through to the equations of motion is fixed once the Lagrangian is specified, and one can be certain what the conclusions of the theory are for a given Lagrangian. We apply this approach to f(R) theories and find that Palatini-type variational equations are favoured, although with torsion being inevitable as well. However, the torsion is found to be of a type that does not directly affect the equations of motion for particles and fields, entering only via its indirect effects on the metric. A particular popular choice of f(R) aimed at giving late-time acceleration of the Universe is then investigated, and it is found that while it succeeds in its cosmological purpose, it has surprising effects both on the dark energy equation of state and the rotation curves of galaxies.
WALDYR	RODRIGUES	talkPhysics	physics, field theory, differential geometry	talkStandardModel	Yes	Coming		Notes on Conservation Laws, Equations of Motion of Matter Fields, Lie Derivative of Spinor Fields in Lorentzian and Teleparallel de Sitter Spacetime Structures		In this paper we discuss the physics of interacting tensor (and spinor fields) and particles living in a de Sitter manifold M=S0(1,4)/S0(1,3)≃R×S³ interpreted as a submanifold of M=R⁵,g), with g a metric of signature (1,4). The pair (M,g) where g is the pullback metric of g (g=i^{∗}g) is Lorentzian manifold that is oriented by τ_{g} and time oriented by ↑. It is the structure (M,g,τ_{g},↑) that is primely used to study the energy-momentum conservation law for a system of physical fields living in M and the true equation of motion for free particles that can be derived using Papapetrou's method. To achieve our objectives we construct two different de Sitter spacetime structures M^{dSL}=(M,g,D,τ_{g},↑) and M^{dSTP}=(M,g,∇,τ_{g},↑), where D is the Levi-Civita connection of g and ∇ is a metric compatible parallel connection. Both connections are introduced in our study only as mathematical devices, no special physical meaning is attributed to these objects. In particular M^{dSL} is not supposed to be the model of any gravitational field in the General Relativity Theory (GRT). Our approach permit to clarify some odd misconceptions appearing in the literature. Our paper also deals with the delicate question of defining a meaningful Lie derivative for spinor fields in (M,g) and we claim to have a a geometrical based definition not involving any covariant derivative and which differs from Kosmann's formula.The paper makes use of the Clifford bundle formalism recalled in one of the appendices, something needed for a nice presentation of the concept of a Komar current J_{A} (in GRT) associated to any vector field A generating a one parameter group of diffeomorphisms . The explicit formula for J_{A} in terms of the energy-momentum tensor of the fields and its physical meaning is given. Besides that we show how F=dA (A=g(A, ) satisfy a Maxwell like equation ∂F=J_{A} which encodes the contents of Einstein equation.
MURAT	TANISLI	talkPhysics	algebra, electromagnetism	talk		Coming	Aug 5	ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY CONSERVATION WITH OCTON	TULAY TOLAN, SULEYMAN DEMIR	The electromagnetic energy conservation with magnetic monopole in terms of a new algebraic structure named as octon is written. It is known that octons generated from the Clifford algebras by Mironov and Mironov, are a new algebraic structure consisting of four parts as scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and pseudovector and its algebra is associative non-commutative just like quaternions and Pauli algebra. Pauli algebra is the Clifford algebra built on the three basis vectors, which represented by complex quaternions of three-dimensional Euclidean space. Octon algebra can be considered as the variant of complexified Clifford algebra. However, its unit vectors a1, a2, a3 and e1, e2, e3 are real true vectors but not complex numbers. In literature, the octon’s geometrical representations have a clear well-defined geometric interpretation. Here we emphasize once again that octons consist of real scalar and vectors but not hypercomplex numbers, and they are very convenient for physical calculations and symmetry analysis. The imaginary unit in multiplication rules is due to the possibility of Clifford product. Vector (Heaviside-Gibbs) algebra is different from Clifford algebra. Octons have very clear scalar-vector interpretation. The main advantage of octons is pseudoscalar unit a0, which allows one to take into account the symmetry of different physical vectors in accordance with spatial inversion. This is very important from the point of physical applications.

On one hand the are the building blocks of monogenic signals and on the other hand the also can be used as an substitue (in some sense) of derivatives in imaging and image processing. In this talk we would like to highlight the role of the Riesz transforms, fractional Riesz transforms and some fractional-type monogenic signals. These generalizations are based on quaternionic and Clifford calculus. 
Isabel	Cacao	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Quaternionic Zernike Spherical Polynomials	João Morais, CIDMA, University of Aveiro, Portugal	The so-called Zernike polynomials (ZPs) were introduced by F. Zernike's Nobel prize in 1934 in connection to diffraction theory. They are constituted by the product of radial polynomials by a pair of trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) and they form a complete set of orthogonal polynomials over the unit circle. Since their appearance, a significant number of publications describing various applications of the ZPs have emerged, mainly in optical engineering. They seem to be well-adapted to corneal surface modeling and they are commonly used to describe balanced aberrations. In this talk, we introduce the Zernike spherical polynomials within quaternionic analysis extending the classical two dimensional ZPs to dimension 3 or 4 in the quaternion algebra's framework. The representation of these functions in terms of spherical monogenics over the unit sphere are explicitly given, from which several recurrence formulae for faster computations can be derived. A summary of their fundamental properties and a second order differential equation are also discussed.

Lander	Cnudde	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Slice monogenic functions: algebraic approach and associated Clifford-Fourier transform	Hendrik De Bie, Guangbin Ren	In recent years, the study of slice monogenic functions has attracted more and more attention in the literature. In this talk, an extension of the well-known Dirac operator is defined which allows to establish the Lie superalgebra structure behind the theory of slice monogenic functions. According to this slice Dirac operator, an inner product is defined on a corresponding function space. Based on the polynomial null-solutions of this differential operator, an analogue to the classical Hermite polynomials is constructed. Together with the inner product, these polynomials allow for the construction of orthogonal and normalised Clifford-Hermite functions. Being analogues of the classical Hermite functions, they can be seen as eigenfunctions of a Clifford-Fourier transform. Corresponding to the Mehler formula in classical Fourier transform theory, a Mehler kernel is found for this Clifford-Fourier transform and its differential properties are investigated. The similarities between these properties and the differential properties of the classical Fourier kernel evoke a closer study of the solutions of the corresponding partial differential equation.
Fabrizio	Colombo	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Some results on the F-functional calculus		In this talk we introduce the two possible formulations of the F-functional calculus which are based on the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem in integral form. In the case of dimension 3 we show that there exists the F-resolvent equation and we study the analogue of the Riesz projectors associated with this calculus. Moreover, we show that it is possible to define this calculus also for n-tuples of unbounded operators and we obtain an integral representation formula analogous to the one of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus for unbounded operators acting on a complex Banach space.
Hendrik	De Bie	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		The kernel of the Dunkl Dirac operator as a module for the Bannai-Ito algebra	Vincent Genest, Luc Vinet	In this talk I will discuss how the CK or Cauchy-Kowalewska extension procedure can be developed for the Dunkl Dirac operator related to the reflection group (Z2)m. This will be used to construct an explicit basis for the kernel in dimension three, expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. In turn, by determining the symmetries of the Dunkl Dirac operator in dimension three, we obtain an unexpected connection with the Bannai-Ito algebra and with a scalar operator that also factorizes the Dunkl Laplacian. A detailed comparison will be given between the two approaches. 
Hilde	De Ridder	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Fueter's theorem in discrete Clifford analysis	F. Sommen	In 1935, R. Fueter described in his paper [1] a technique to obtain monogenic quaternionic functions, starting from a holomorphic function in the upper half of the complex plane. This classical result was later generalized to R0,m for m odd by Sce [2], for m even by [3] and by Sommen in [4]: if m is an odd positive integer and Pk(x−) is a homogeneous monogenic polynomial of degree k in Rm, then Δk+m−12x[(u(x0,r)+ω−v(x0,r))Pk(x−)] is also monogenic in Ω˜. In this presentation, we consider a discretization of Sommen's result to the setting of (hermitean) discrete Clifford analysis in even dimension: starting from a discrete monogenic function in Z2, we will construct monogenic functions on Zm.

We prove necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the operator L under which L is associated with the operator D. This criterion makes it possible to construct operators L for which the initial value problem is uniquely soluble for an arbitrary initial q-generalized regular function Ψ(x) by the method of associated spaces constructed by W. Tutschke (Teubner Leipzig and Springer Verlag, 1989) and the solution is also q-generalized regular for each t. 
Sirkka-Liisa 	Eriksson	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Cauchy type integral formulas for k-hypermonogenic functions	Heikki Orelma	Our aim is to build a function theory based on hyperbolic metric of the Poincare upper half space model and Clifford numbers. We consider harmonic functions with respect to the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the Riemannian metric ds2=x−2kn−12(∑ni=0dx2i) and their function theory in Rn+1. H. Leutwiler in 1992 discovered that the power function, calculated using the Clifford product, is a conjugate gradient of a harmonic function with respect to the hyperbolic metric. He started to research these type of functions, called H-solutions, satisfying a modified Dirac equation, connected to the hyperbolic metric. All usual trigonometric and exponential functions have a natural extensions to H-solutions. S.-L. Eriksson and H. Leutwiler, extended H-solutions to total algebra valued functions, called hypermonogenic functions. We study generalized hypermonogenic functions, called k−hypermonogenic functions. For example the function |x|k−n+1x−1 is k-hypermonogenic. Note that 0-hypermonogenic are monogenic and n−1 -hypermonogenic functions are hypermonogenic We verify the Cauchy type integral formulas for k-hypermonogenic functions where the kernels are calculated using the hyperbolic distance of the Poincare upper half space model. There formulas are different in even and odd cases. Earlier these results have been proved for hypermonogenic functions. The coauthor of the work is Heikki Orelma, Tampere University of Technology. 
Dmitrii	Legatiuk	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Theoretical aspects of coupling of function theoretic methods and finite element method	Klaus Gürlebeck	In this talk is to present important steps in a process of coupling of an analytical solution with the finite element method. Based on previous results we summarize a theory of such coupling. We present the goal of the coupling, and we describe the procedure which assures a continuous coupling between two solutions. Finally, we show results about the convergence of the proposed mixed scheme. We start by developing a theory for two-dimensional problems of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and in the end we present a concept for a generalisation of the proposed method to spatial problems.
Paul	Leopardi	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming	Not Aug 9 (bus from Tartu to Tallinn will leave Aug 9, 10:00)	The abstract Hodge-Dirac operator and its stable discretization	Ari Stern, WUSTL	We adapt the techniques of finite element exterior calculus to study and discretize the abstract Hodge-Dirac operator, which is a square root of the abstract Hodge-Laplace operator considered by Arnold, Falk, and Winther (2010). We give a priori stability and convergence estimates, and show that several of the results in finite element exterior calculus can be recovered as corollaries of these new estimates. See the preprint arXiv:1401.1576 [math.NA] for details.

CMFT, vol. 12 (2012), No. 2, 371-391) we present several recurrence formulae for orthogonal monogenic polynomials in the kernel of the generalized Cauchy-Riemann operator. This includes also a detailed analysis of the involved matrices and combinatorial relationships between the structural constants of homogeneous monogenic polynomials.
Heikki	Orelma	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes			Vekua systems in Hyperbolic Harmonic Analysis		We consider the solutions of the equation Mκf=0, where Mκ is the so called modifier Dirac operator acting on functions f defined in the upper half space and taking values in the Clifford algebra. We look for solutions f(x−,xn) where the first variable is invariant under rotations. A special type of solution is generated by the so called spherical monogenic functions. These solutions may be characterize by a vekua-type system and this system may be solved using Bessel functions. We will see that the solution of the equation Mκf=0 in this case will be a product of Bessel functions.
Roy	Oste	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes	Coming		Unique characterization of the Fourier transform and generalized transforms	Hendrik De Bie, Joris Van der Jeugt	The Fourier transform (FT) is of crucial importance in a whole range of areas such as harmonic analysis and signal processing as it has many interesting properties. A natural question is: Which properties are sufficient to uniquely characterize the FT? Additionally, given a specific set of properties of the FT, one can inquire whether there are any other transforms that satisfy these properties. In order to answer these questions, we work in the framework of representation theory of the Lie algebra sl2, and its refinement the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). This natural generalization brings us to the setting of Clifford analysis, where we obtain generalized Fourier transforms that act on functions taking values in a Clifford algebra.

In particular, we focus on Hermite polynomials, Bessel functions, and generalized powers. We also derive a Vekua-type system for solutions of Hermitian systems in axially symmetric domains.
Matthias	Roels	talkAnalysis		talkAnalysis	Yes			Scalar higher spin operators in Clifford analysis	David Eelbode, Hendrik De Bie	Clifford analysis has become a branch of multi-dimensional analysis in which far-reaching generalisations of the classical Cauchy-Riemann operator in complex analysis are studied from a function theoretical point of view. Without claiming completeness, one could say that the theory focuses on first-order conformally invariant operators acting on functions taking values in irreducible representations for the spin group. This then leads to function theories refining (poly-)harmonic analysis on Rm. In this talk we will explain how to extend these results to a certain class of second-order conformally invariant operators, leading to analogues of the Rarita-Schwinger function theory for functions taking values in the space of harmonics (at the same time generalising classical harmonic analysis for the Laplace operator). After a brief introduction to some notions of differential geometry, we will give a detailed description on how to define and construct this class of operators. As some equations of motion that often appear in physics are expressed in terms of these operators, we will explain how to translate our notation to the tensor notation used by physicists. Finally, some function theoretical results that were already obtained or are under construction will be discussed.

Gal	2) In this talk we discuss some approximation properties of slice hyperholomorphic functions of one quaternionic variable. As it is well known, this class of functions contains converging power series of the variable. We show that an almost universal property holds:for any $0<r<R$, there exists a quaternionic power series of radius $r$, with the property that for any axially symmetric open set $\Omega$ with $\Omega \bigcap \overline{B(0;R)}=\emptyset$, any compact axially symmetric $K\subset \Omega$ with $\mathbb{H}\setminus K$ connected, $\mathbb{C}_I\setminus (K\cap \mathbb{C}_I)$ connected (for all $I$ in the sphere of purely imaginary unitary quaternions) and $h:\Omega\to \mathbb{C}$ slice regular in $\Omega$,there exists a subsequence of the partial sums sequence which converges uniformly to $h$ on $K$.We also discuss the validity of Mergelyan-type results, by showinguniform approximation results of slice hyperholomorphic functions by polynomials, in the case of starlike setsand axially symmetric sets.\vskip 0.3truecm\noindent S.

Michael	Wutzig	talkAnalysis	analysis, Fourier	talk	Yes			Reproducing kernels in hermitian Clifford analysis	Hendrik De Bie, Frank Sommen	The study of homogeneous polynomials plays an important role in various settings of mathematical analysis. Harmonic homogenous polynomials (which are called spherical harmonics) are a powerful tool in harmonic analysis and provide a connection to Fourier analysis. In Clifford analysis one studies homogeneous polynomials that are null-solutions of the Dirac operator and are therefore named spherical monogenics. In all settings one essential property of homogeneous polynomials is the existence of a unique reproducing kernel. We will give an overview of these kernels, show a way to determine the (yet unknown) reproducing kernel in the hermitian setting of Clifford analysis and show its connection to the case of (complex) harmonic analysis.

This transformation is constructed by using group actions in a geometric approach, introduced by Batard, Bethier and Saint-Jean. It is defined on vector-valued functions in the Clifford algebra R4,0, so the question arises how this transform acts on the basis elements of this space. We prove that both the cartesian and spherical basis are well-behaved under this transform. This is rather surprising as most other hypercomplex Fourier transforms are only diagonalized by one of these bases.

The estimation of image feature orientation is an important task in pattern recognition and other applications.

For example, the rotations taking us from camera 1 to camera 2 (R12), from camera 1 to camera 3 (R13) and from camera 2 to camera 3 (R23), can all be estimated from real world data – but these estimates will generally not satisfy R13=R23R12, as they should. This talk will show how we can use Geometric Algebra to obtain optimal (in a defined sense) estimates from any numberof relative rotations. The results are compared with standard linear algebra solutions to this problem and specific applications are discussed.

In this paper, in analogy to Sahin and Yuce, we obtain a formula for the higher order accelerations and poles under the one parameter planar hyperbolic homothetic motion.

According to Grassmann, a line is the exterior product of two points, a plane is the exterior product of three points, and an extension having what we now call n dimension is the exterior product of n+1 points [2]. Also, the exterior product of a line and a point is a plane, and the exterior product of two non-intersecting lines is the affine space. How should we explain this Grassmann’s point geometry to our pupils instead of the usual vector geometry? The algebraic way to teach it [3] is by using barycentric and homogeneous coordinates [4]. It will be shown that they have many advantages such as the natural introduction to projective geometry and duality which become trivial when they are understood by means of pencils of lines and sheaves of planes.

I must always remember Garret Sobczyk, Hestenes's Ph. D. student (Thesis in 1971) - Garret's fascinating 1971-Seminar lecture brought Cli ord algebra to Poland.

Carlos 	Castro Perelman 	talkPlenary		talk	(Waived)	Coming	not Aug 9	Novel Physical Consequences of Clifford Space Relativity Theory 		Novel physical consequences of the Extended Relativity Theory in C-spaces (Clifford spaces) are explored. The latter theory provides a very different physical explanation of the phenomenon of "relativity of locality" than the one described by the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) framework. Furthermore, an elegant nonlinear momentum-addition law is derived in order to tackle the "soccer-ball'' problem in DSR. Neither derivation in C-spaces requires a curved momentum space nor a deformation of the Lorentz algebra. While the constant (energy-independent) speed of photon propagation is always compatible with the generalized photon dispersion relations in C-spaces, another important consequence is that these generalized photon dispersion relations allow also for energy-dependent speeds of propagation while still retaining the Lorentz symmetry in ordinary spacetimes, while breaking the extended Lorentz symmetry in C-spaces. This does not occur in DSR nor in other approaches, like the presence of quantum spacetime foam. We conclude with some comments on generalized gravitational theories in C-spaces, Born's Reciprocal Relativity Theory and the generalized uncertainty relations.

Geometric concepts such as primitive geometric forms, the principle of duality, cross ratio and projective mappings are introduced. Projective mappings Φ preserve the ∧ and the ∨ product; one of both by definition, the second up to the factor detΦ.

David	Eelbode	talkPlenary		talk	Yes	Coming		(1) Transvector algebras in Clifford analysis		(1) The starting point for this talk is the observation that classical harmonic and Clifford analysis are related to the representation theory for the Lie algebra sl(2) or its orthosymplectic refinement osp(1,2). These objects appear quite naturally as the Howe dual for the spin group, which acts on the space of smooth functions on Rm with values in either the trivial or spinor representation. In recent years it has become clear that Clifford analysis techniques can also be used to study more complicated conformally invariant differential operators (as classified by Fegan in his seminal paper from 1976), which then act on functions on Rm with values in more complicated representations for the spin group. Despite the fact that the algebraic framework describing the Howe duality in several variables is well-understood, in terms of the symplectic Lie algebra sp(2k) or its refinement osp(1,2k), we believe that this is not the only algebra which appears naturally within the setting of higher spin analysis. The aim of the lecture therefore, is to introduce the so-called transvector algebras (which are related to Yangians, as introduced in the framework of the Yang-Baxter equation) and to explain how they show up in various aspects of higher dimensional analysis.

Main topics are the characterization of hyperholomorphic functions by their geometrical mapping properties, the derivability and the construction of Taylor-type series expansions based on certain polynomial Appell systems. In a second step the relation of ψ-hyperholomorphic functions to harmonic functions will be studied in the non-trivial case of mappings from R3↦R3 and an additive decomposition of harmonic functions in terms of ψ-hyperholomorphic functions will be proved. As applications we will discuss geometric properties of ψ-hyperholomorphic functions and the application to boundary value problems from linear elasticity.

We establish that these two algebras exhibit the same formal feature set for doing euclidean geometry. We then compare them with respect to a set of practical criteria.

But it seems natural to define a quaternion Fourier transform for quaternion valued signals over \textit{quaternion domains}. Such signals may e.g. represent vector fields in space and time. The quaternion domain Fourier transform thus developed may also be useful for solving quaternion partial differential equations or functional equations, three-dimensional time-dependent color field (space color video) processing, and in crystallography. We define the \textit{quaternion domain Fourier transform} and analyze its \textit{main properties}, including quaternion dilation, modulation and shift properties, Plancherel and Parseval identities, covariance under orthogonal transformations, transformations of coordinate polynomials and differential operator polynomials, transformations of derivative and Dirac derivative operators, as well as signal width related to band width uncertainty relationships.

The approach also leads to a Dirac-like generalization of the Schroedinger equation with the mass term replace by the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian operator. This formulation leads to an interesting class of problems which can be studied using the techniques of Clifford analysis. I will also discuss how the precanonical approach leads to a nonperturbative quantization of gravity where the quantum geometry is described by Clifford-valued transition amplitudes between different values of spin connection at different points. I show that the fundamental equation which describes the quantum geometry in this approach is a Clifford-algebraic matrix multi-variable generalization of the confluent hypergeometric equation. Thus the needs of quantum gravity call for a study of generalizations of hypergeometric functions within the Clifford analysis.

Describing a wave with spin 1/2, the Dirac equation is form invariant under a group which is not the Lorentz group. This SL(2,C) group is a subgroup of Cl∗3=GL(2,C) which is the true group of form invariance of the Dirac equation. Firstly we use the Cl3 algebra to read all features of the Dirac equation for a wave with spin 1/2. We extend this to electromagnetic laws. Next we use both the Cl3 algebra and the space-time algebra to get the gauge group of the electro-weak interactions, first in the leptonic case, electron+neutrino, next in the quark case. The complete wave for all objects of the first generation uses two supplementary dimensions of space and the Clifford algebra Cl5,1. It is a function of the usual space-time with value into this enlarged algebra. The gauge group is then enlarged into a U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) Lie group in a way which gives automatically the insensitivity of electrons and neutrinos to strong interactions. This study gives new insights for many features of the standard model. It explains also how to get three generations and four kinds of neutrinos. We encounter not only two remarkable identities, we are able to explain several enigmas, like the existence of the Planck constant or why the great unification based on SU(5) could not be successful. We consolidate both the standard model and the use of Clifford algebras as the true mathematical frame of quantum physics. We present in concluding remarks a simple solution to integrate together gravitation and quantum physics. Then the only great domain of physics which remains to study is the electromagnetism with magnetic monopoles.
Cohl	Furey	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	Yes	Coming		Charge Quantization from a Number Operator		In the early seventies, Gunaydin and Gursey discovered SUc(3) quark structure in the split octonions. Using their anti-commuting ladder operators, αi, we show a direct route to a new U(1) generator. This U(1) generator behaves like electric charge, thereby allowing us to further identify states behaving like the electron and neutrino. Our proposed electric charge turns out to be proportional to a number operator, consequently illuminating why it is quantized. Using only this trio of ladder operators, and their conjugates, we construct a pair of minimal left ideals, which is shown to transform under SUc(3) and Uem(1) as does a full generation of the standard model. 
Igor	Kanatchikov	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	Yes	Coming		2) On the structure of Standard Model from the point of view of precanonical quantization (in "Geometric Algebra and Calculus in the Standard Model of Particle Physics")		2) The approach of precanonical quantization of fields leads to a generalization of quantum theoretic formalism from mechanics to field theory. where the space-time Clifford algebra (which arises from quantization of differential forms) plays as important role as the complex numbers in quantum mechanics do. In this approach the space-time variables are treated on the equal footing and they play a role of the multidimensional analogue of the time parameter in quantum mechanics. I briefly discuss the relation between precanonical quantization and the standard QFT in the functional Schroedinger representation and few interesting consequences of the application of precanonical quantization in the context of perturbative QFT (an application to quantum gravity will be discussed in the talk at the general session). I also demonstrate that precanonical quantization of fermions naturally leads to the restriction of the number of fermionic fields which we can be incorporated into the (precanonically quantized) theory simultaneously in the way compatible with the standard functional Schroedinger representation. The number of fermions can not exceed the ability of the most general Clifford number on the space-time to embed the fermions in a linear way. This fact may have consequences for our understanding of the origin of symmetries of the Standard Model, as the latter should be related to the linear automorphisms of the space-time Clifford algebra and the dimensionality of the space-time, and also shed light on the possible nature of the generations of fundamental fermions. 
Nikolay	Marchuk	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel				One spectral property of Yang-Mills operator		Yang-Mills equations are used in Standard Model of elementary particles for description of electroweak and strong interactions. Consider an eigenvalue problem for the Yang-Mills operator. We've found one nonzero eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector for the Yang-Mills operator. On this basis we present a new class of gauge invariant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations. 
Gene	McClellan	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	Yes	Coming		A Laboratory-Frame View of the Dirac Electron Field Using Geometric Algebra		The geometric algebra and calculus of 3-D Euclidean space in a laboratory frame is sufficient to formulate and solve the Dirac equation as well as the Maxwell equations. The Dirac electron field at a given point in space is expressed as a linear combination of the algebraic basis elements of the geometric algebra of the tangent space at that point. The eight independent basis elements of the geometric algebra are sufficient to substitute for the eight independent quantities in the four complex components of the traditional Dirac spinor, providing a geometric interpretation of the Dirac field as first proposed by Hestenes. Most authors have worked with covariant formulations of the Maxwell and Dirac equations expressed in spacetime algebra (STA); however, a spacetime split of these equations yields equivalent equations for any given laboratory frame. Expressing the Dirac field in the laboratory frame greatly facilitates visualization of solutions of the Dirac equation and provides insight into the nature of spin up vs. spin down states and the distinction between electron and positron states. This presentation will include animations illustrating the Dirac fields for states at rest. Comparison with electromagnetic plane waves suggests physical insight into electron-positron annihilation, a basic process of the Standard Model.
Garret	Sobczyk	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	 			Geometry of Spin 1/2 Particles		The geometric algebras of space and spacetime are derived by sucessively extending the real number system to include new mutually anticommuting square roots of +1 and -1. The quantum mechanics of spin 1/2 particles are then expressed in these geometric algebras. Classical 2 and 4 component Cartan spinors are represented by geometric numbers which have parity, providing new insight into the familiar bra-ket formalism of Dirac. The classical Dirac Equation is shown to be equivalent to the Dirac-Hestenes equation, so long as the issue of parity is not taken into consideration, the latter quantity being constructed in such a way that it is parity invariant.

Thierry	Socroun	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel		Coming	(leaving flight Aug 9 18:00)	Clifford to unify General Relativity and Electromagnetism		A double transformation of the usual Lagrangian for a particle (1) and a test particle (2), and the right values of integration constants make it possible to unify General Relativity and Electromagnetism. The new Lagrangian has to be completely symmetric between the 2 particles and is no longer real but is a Clifford. The new theory will then contain the Dirac equation and the Reissner-Nordstrom solution which are both limit cases.
Piotr	Zenczykowski	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	Yes	Coming	(leaving flight Aug 9 17:55)	From Clifford Algebra of Nonrelativistic Phase Space to Quarks and Leptons of the Standard Model		The talk will review a Clifford-algebra-related approach to elementary particles recently presented in my book "Elementary Particles and Emergent Phase Space" (World Scientific). The proposed scheme succesfully explains several features of a single generation of elementary particles (as defined in the Standard Model). The review will contain several interrelated parts: 1) BACKGROUND: a) a philosophical background motivating a maximally symmetric treatment of position and momentum variables (whence phase space), b) an analysis of what current theory and phenomenology really tell us about the concept of quark mass (i.e. the minimal assumptions needed in quark mass extraction procedures) 2) CLIFFORD ALGEBRA of NONRELATIVISTIC PHASE SPACE c) an introduction of a novel variation on Born's reciprocity idea which provides a new possible view on the problem of mass, d) a presentation of author's original approach to space quantization based on Dirac-like linearization of nonrelativistic quadratic form p^2+x^2 (with momentum and position satisfying standard commutation relations), which leads to the emergence of internal quantum numbers naturally identifiable with isospin and colour, 3) CONNECTION TO CURRENT MODELS OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES e) a comparison of the resulting Clifford-algebra-based explanation of a single generation of elementary particles with that provided by the celebrated Harari-Shupe rishon (subquark) model. f) a discussion of how the additivity of momenta may be generalized and used in the construction of hadrons as composite systems of quarks, together with a proposal for a restoration of special relativity at the colourless hadronic level. 
Jose G.	Vargas	talkStandardModel		talkStandardModel	(Waived)	Coming	(leaving in late afternoon Aug 9 or Aug 10)	2. U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) from the Tangent Bundle		2. In this paper, we revisit E. Kaehler's treatment of Poincare symmetry as it reflects itself in members of the left ideals ---in the Clifford algebra of scalar-valued differential forms--- generated by primitive idempotents for time translation and third component of angular momentum symmetry (read rest mass and spin). We replace that algebra with a Clifford algebra of Clifford-valued differential forms that makes the unit imaginary unnecessary. It has a commutative subalgebra of ``mirror elements'', i.e. where the valuedness is dual to the differential form and where even the idempotents for components of angular momentum commute. In Kaehler's treatment, total angular momentum is a differential 2−form operator (not a vector operator!). One need not first square it before using it. Of course, one reproduces standard results from repeated application of the operator. Additional subtleties and enhanced computational power follow from reproducing his treatmen in the commutative subalgebra. The so enriched theory of angular momentum and of primitive idempotents becomes the foundation for an interplay of all three components of angular momentum and time and space translations. The expansion of the set of primitive idempotents uncovers an algebraic representation of quarks, which does not mean, however, similar behavior for the new members of that set. Quarks are "different type particles". An algebraic stoichiometry of fundamental particles emerges in that commutative algebra. It includes neutron decay and pair creation-annihilation. The geometric nature of the algebras involved makes obvious why there are only three generations with two flavors each, only three colors and why the triple of electron, muon and tau are respectively associated with the three generations.
